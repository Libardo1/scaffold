Introduction
============

**Scaffold** is a system for managing analyses of stochastic iterative algorithms.

Purpose
---------

* Provide an easy way to run horserace-style experiments between different inference algorithms
* Ease collaboration with others by imposing a common discipline for writing iterative algorithms
* Abstract away the details of remote computation
